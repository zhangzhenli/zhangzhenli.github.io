    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Modern semantic segmentation frameworks usually combine low-level and high-level features from pre-trained backbone convolutional models to boost performance. In this paper, we first point out that a simple fusion of low-level and high-level features could be less effective because of the gap in semantic levels and spatial resolution. We find that introducing semantic information into low-level features and high-resolution details into high-level features is more effective for the later fusion. Based on this observation, we propose a new framework, named ExFuse, to bridge the gap between low-level and high-level features thus significantly improve the segmentation quality by 4.0&#37; in total. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark and achieve 87.9&#37; mean IoU, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper investigates the role played by informational frictions in college and the workplace. We estimate a dynamic structural model of schooling and work decisions, where individuals have imperfect information about their schooling ability and labor market productivity. We take into account the heterogeneity in schooling investments by distinguishing between two- and four-year colleges, graduate school, as well as science and non-science majors for four-year colleges. Individuals may also choose whether to work full-time, part-time, or not at all. A key feature of our approach is to account for correlated learning through college grades and wages, whereby individuals may leave or re-enter college as a result of the arrival of new information on their ability and productivity. Our findings indicate that the elimination of informational frictions would increase the college graduation rate by 9 percentage points, and would increase the college wage premium by 32.7 percentage points through increased sorting on ability. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper investigates the wage returns to schooling and actual early work experiences, and how these returns have changed over the past twenty years. Using the NLSY surveys, we develop and estimate a dynamic model of the joint schooling and work decisions that young men make in early adulthood, and quantify how they affect wages using a generalized Mincerian specification. Our results highlight the need to account for dynamic selection and changes in composition when analyzing changes in wage returns. In particular, we find that ignoring the selectivity of accumulated work experiences results in overstatements of the returns to education. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines effects of the U.S. Immigration Act of 1990 on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and labor market outcomes for nativeborn Americans. The Act increased the in-flow and stock of foreign STEM workers in the U.S., potentially altering the relative desirability of STEM fields for natives. The authors examine effects of the policy on STEM degree completion, STEM occupational choice, and employment rates separately for black and white men and women. The novel identification strategy measures exposure to foreign STEM workers of age-18 native cohorts immediately before and after the policy change via geographic dispersion of foreign-born STEM workers in 1980, which predicts subsequent foreign STEM flows. The Act affected natives in three ways: (1) it pushed black men out of STEM majors; (2) it pushed white male STEM graduates out of STEM occupations; and (3) it pushed white female STEM graduates out of the workforce. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines trends in the college wage premium (CWP) by birth cohort across the five major household surveys in the United States: the Census/ACS, CPS, NLSY, PSID, and SIPP. We document a flattening in the CWP for birth cohorts 1978 and onward in each survey and even a decline for birth cohorts 1980–1985 in the NLSY and SIPP. We discuss potential reasons for this finding and show that the empirical discrepancy is not a function of differences in composition across surveys. Our results provide crucial context for the vast economic literatures that use these surveys to measure returns to skill, and intertemporal changes in those returns.</div></p>

    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the role of labor market frictions and moving costs in explaining the migration behavior of US workers by employment status. Using data on low-skilled workers from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), I estimate a dynamic model of individual labor supply and migration decisions. The model accounts for the fact that geographical moves are not random, and that workers may move for reasons unrelated to the labor market. My estimates show that moving costs are substantial, and that labor market frictions particularly inhibit movement of the employed. I use the model to study migration responses to local labor market shocks and to a moving subsidy. Workers' preferences for non-market amenities, coupled with substantial moving costs and employment frictions, grant market power to incumbent employers. This market power is most likely to exist in specialized industries where within-location job hopping is infeasible. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> I examine the extent to which the returns to college majors are influenced by selective migration and occupational choice across locations in the US. To quantify the role of selection, I develop and estimate an extended Roy model of migration, occupational choice, and earnings where, upon completing their education, individuals choose a location in which to live and an occupation in which to work. In order to estimate this high-dimensional choice model, I make use of machine learning methods that allow for model selection and estimation simultaneously in a non-parametric setting. I find that OLS estimates of the returns to business and STEM majors relative to education majors are upward biased by 15% on average and by as much as 30%. Using estimates of the model, I characterize the migration behavior of different college majors and find that migration flows are twice as sensitive to occupational concentration as they are to wage returns. This finding has important implications for local governments seeking to attract or retain skilled workers. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Residential mobility rates in the U.S. have fallen steadily over the past three decades. While 19.6% of U.S. residents changed residence within the United States in 1985, only 10.6% did so in 2017, its lowest level since 1948 when the Census Bureau began tracking mobility.  There is growing concern about its implication for efficient labor and resource allocation, potentially lowering productivity growth. Moreover, given the importance of migration for upward mobility the especially large declines seen in residential mobility among lower skilled workers, with many no longer willing or able to leave declining urban and rural areas, is particularly worrisome, likely contributing to reduced economic mobility and increased inequality.
    
    The cause of the long-term decline in mobility remains largely unexplained. A sizeable and growing number of studies have investigated the role of changes in demographics (aging; delayed family formation), the housing market (negative equity and home-lock; rise and heterogeneity in cost of housing), the labor market (reduced job opportunities during the recession; expansion of telecommuting and flexible work schedules; increased state-level occupational licensing and reduced transferability of seniority across states),  government policies (homeowner subsidies; location-based welfare and pension benefits; land use regulations), and changes in cultural values. While many of these changes may have played some role, none seem able to explain the broad-based longer-term decline in mobility seen within each age, gender, race, income, home ownership and employment status over the past decades.

To make progress in analyzing the causes and consequences of reduced migration requires a better understanding of residential location-  and mobility-relevant preferences. In this paper we investigate the relative importance of alternative drivers of residential mobility, including job opportunities, neighborhood and housing amenities, social networks and housing and moving costs, using data from two different waves of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. We do so using a hypothetical choice methodology, akin to a stated-choice approach, where we present survey respondents a series of hypothetical migration choice scenarios and elicit their expected future mobility choices. The experimental variation generated by these scenarios allows estimation of the distribution of preferences for location and mobility attributes, without concerns about omitted variables and selection biases that hamper analyses based on observed mobility choices alone.  We estimate substantial heterogeneity in the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for location and housing amenities across different demographic groups.</div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </div></p>
